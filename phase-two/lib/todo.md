# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

    As a user
    So that I can keep track of my tasks
    I want a program that I can add todo tasks to and see a list of them.

    As a user
    So that I can focus on tasks to complete
    I want to mark tasks as complete and have them disappear from the list.

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# 1
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("Walk the dog")
reminder.remind() # => "Walk the dog, Kay!"

# 2
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind() # fails with "No task set."

# 3
reminder = Reminder("Kay")
reminder.remind_me_to("")
reminder.remind() # => ", Kay!"
```

_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
