# {{PROBLEM}} Class Design Recipe

## 1. Describe the Problem

## 2. Design the Class Interface

The interface of a class includes:

- The name of the class.
- The design of its initializer and the parameters it takes.
- The design of its public methods, including:
  - Their names and purposes
  - What parameters they take and the data types.
  - What they return and that data type

Steps 3 and 4 then operate as a cycle.

## 3. Create Examples as Tests

_Make a list of examples of how the class will behave in different situations._

```ruby
# EXAMPLE



_Encode each example as a test. You can add to the above list as you go._

## 4. Implement the Behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._


```
